defmodule Harness.DelayedServing do
  @moduledoc """
  Start the Nx serving, but it happens async so the application can boot up and
  be "healthy".

  The purpose of this GenServer is to start the `Nx.Serving` for the desired
  module. Large models can take several minutes to download and process before
  they are available to the application. This GenServer can be added to the
  Application supervision tree. It detects and logs if Elixir has CUDA access to
  the GPU. If support is available, it starts the serving and makes it available
  to the application.

  That is the sole purpose for this module. Without this delayed approach, the
  extended start-up times can result in an application being found "unhealthy",
  and killed before ever becoming active.
